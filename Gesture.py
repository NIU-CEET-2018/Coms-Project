# AI Multi-Path
"""An AI multiplexer.

A trainable generator that is constructed on two generators, the first
of which is the simplistic but functional generator and the second of
which is the trainable but notes necessary good. The system will
assume that he second starts off as not very good but as it trained
will eventually swap out the old version for better/trained second
version. This will occur over many runs of the program as data is
collected and the system trained.

"""Converts bone structure information into probable Gestlets.
(A gestlet is a particular hand position in a gesticulation.)

The system keeps a set of pre-approved Gestlet snapshots and compares
the distance between them and the current gestlet, returning the
normalized reciprocal of their values.
