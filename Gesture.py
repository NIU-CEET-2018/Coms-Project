# AI Multi-Path
"""A trainable generator that is constructed on two generators, the first of which is the simplistic but functional generator and the second of which is the trainable but notes necessary good. The system will assume that he second starts off as not very good but as it trained will eventually swap out the old version for better/trained second version. This will occur over many runs of the program as data is collected and the system trained."""

# Bone_to_Gestlet_GofAI
"""Converts bone structure information into probable Gestlets.
(A gestlet is a particular hand position in a gesticulation.)

The system keeps a set of pre-approved Gestlet snapshots and compares the distance between them and the current gestlet, returning the normalized reciprocal of their values.
